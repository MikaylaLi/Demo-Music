# Simplified Authentication System

The authentication system has been simplified to work consistently across all sub-pages once you're logged in.

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Configuration
The `auth-config.js` file automatically detects the page type and applies the appropriate authentication:

- **Protected Pages**: Require authentication (dashboard, mood-assessment, goals, chatbot)
- **Public Pages**: Redirect to dashboard if already logged in (signin, signup, index)

### 2. Backend Session Validation
The system now validates sessions with the backend server, not just localStorage:

- Checks if user data exists in localStorage
- Validates session with backend API
- Clears invalid sessions automatically
- Maintains consistent auth state across all pages

## Usage

### For Protected Pages
Simply include the auth scripts and the page will automatically require authentication:

```html
<script src="frontend_integration.js"></script>
<script src="auth-config.js"></script>
```

### For Public Pages
Same setup - the system will automatically redirect logged-in users:

```html
<script src="frontend_integration.js"></script>
<script src="auth-config.js"></script>
```

## Key Features

### ✅ Consistent Authentication
- Works the same way on all sub-pages
- No more auth inconsistencies between pages
- Automatic session validation with backend

### ✅ Simplified Setup
- Just include two script files
- No complex auth checking code needed
- Automatic page type detection

### ✅ Smart Redirects
- Path-aware redirects (works with /Demo-Music/ paths)
- Redirects logged-in users away from signin/signup
- Redirects unauthenticated users to signin

### ✅ Session Management
- Validates sessions with backend API
- Clears invalid sessions automatically
- Maintains user state across page refreshes

## Files Modified

1. **frontend_integration.js** - Simplified auth manager with backend validation
2. **auth-config.js** - New automatic auth configuration system
3. **dashboard.html** - Simplified auth checking
4. **mood-assessment.html** - Simplified auth checking
5. **goals.html** - Simplified auth checking
6. **chatbot.html** - Simplified auth checking
7. **signin.html** - Simplified auth checking
8. **signup.html** - Simplified auth checking

## API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/dashboard-stats` - Used for session validation
- `POST /api/login` - User login
- `POST /api/logout` - User logout
- `POST /api/register` - User registration

## Troubleshooting

### If auth isn't working:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify both script files are included
3. Check that the backend server is running
4. Clear browser localStorage and try again

### If redirects aren't working:
1. Check the current URL path
2. Verify the auth-config.js is loaded
3. Check browser console for auth manager initialization

## Migration Notes

The old complex auth checking code has been replaced with simple script includes. All pages now use the same authentication system automatically.
